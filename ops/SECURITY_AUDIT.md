# Security Audit & Final Testing - Week 1

## Security Analysis Tools

### 1. Static Analysis
```bash
# Install security tools
npm install -g @crytic/slither-analyzer
pip install mythril

# Run Slither analysis
slither contracts/ --print human-summary
slither contracts/ --detect all

# Run Mythril analysis  
myth analyze contracts/BlobOptionDesk.sol
myth analyze contracts/CommitRevealBSP.sol
myth analyze contracts/BlobFeeOracle.sol
```

### 2. Test Coverage Analysis
```bash
# Generate coverage report
forge coverage --report lcov
genhtml lcov.info -o coverage/

# Ensure >95% coverage on critical paths:
# - Settlement logic
# - Payout calculations  
# - Oracle integration
# - Access controls
```

### 3. Formal Verification Targets
- [ ] BlobOptionDesk margin calculations always correct
- [ ] CommitRevealBSP payouts never exceed deposits
- [ ] Oracle feeds cannot be manipulated
- [ ] No reentrancy vulnerabilities
- [ ] Access controls properly enforced

### 4. Economic Security Review
- [ ] Flash loan attack vectors
- [ ] MEV manipulation possibilities
- [ ] Oracle manipulation resistance
- [ ] Liquidation mechanics safety
- [ ] Fee calculation accuracy

### 5. Integration Testing
```bash
# Run full integration test suite
npm run test:integration

# Test failure scenarios
npm run test:failure-modes

# Load testing with high gas prices
npm run test:stress
```

## Deliverables
- [ ] Security audit report
- [ ] Test coverage >95%
- [ ] All critical vulnerabilities resolved
- [ ] Economic model validated
- [ ] Gas optimization completed
